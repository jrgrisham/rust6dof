# rust6dof

This project is currently a work-in-progress.  My goal is to build a simple,
easy-to-use 6DOF simulation in Rust which has the following capabilities:

- Monte Carlo simulations
- Guidance for exoatmospheric flight
- RCS control

My long-term goal is to perform cosimulation of cryogenic liquids inside tanks
by coupling this 6DOF with a CFD code.
